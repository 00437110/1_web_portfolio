15 26 He'll open a new project directory.

15 40 Creating a folder through the VS code interface

16 18 Opening a brand new instance of VS code

-----------------

Project 1: Web Portfolio

17 00 We'll use HTMl and CSS

17 40 New File and create index.html

18 00 Special hack: Typing the exclamation key (!) it will suggest a boilerplate code

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head> // meta information about the page, not visible on the website
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body> //what goes in the page
    
</body>
</html>

19 09 in the github repo you can see the actual code

style.css style of the website

content of the website

Theyll be wired later

20 15 downloading css style sheet
https://fantacss.smoljames.com/

it will style all of the layouts

The elements will be done by FantaCSS

https://github.com/jamezmca/full-stack-course
Contains the fanta.css file which can also be used

Download the fanta.css file

21 00 
it will have all the css for this course

the cssallows light and dark theme

21 50 Search for line 66 and 113, select it and delete it.

You can comment it too

It may actually be already commented


22 12 Those 3 files are to be used for now

Create new folder called public

public is for serving public assets, images, video, static information, etc

There will be public thumbnails

22 50 Thumbnails

23 25 We will use default images for now, you can download them from the github repo

24 22 Load up website in development mode

24 55 Download Extension for VS called: Live Server

Install it and you can right click inside the HTML file and this will open the html file in a browser, but serving it up from an URL, and anychanges done in the document will be reflected in the page.

25 50 It will show changes much faster

if you don't get the website shown right there, you can seee the port where it is connected in the lower right corner of VS codee

You can type the port yourself
http://127.0.0.1:5500/1_web_portfolio/index.html

or you can type localhost: 5500 and the name of the portfolio
http://localhost:5500/1_web_portfolio/index.html

This is for development purposes only

27 00 We will wire up the 2 css files to the document

It goes in the head tags which contain the meta information for this project.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fanta.css"/>

It will apply the style to the whole document

28 58 VS code shortcuts

https://www.vscodeshortcuts.smoljames.com/
It has commands used regularly

you can add to the github if you wish

29 45 Finishing the head section

Give it a title and it will change

<title>Erick Style Portfolio</title>

30 20 Giving content to the page

Use <header> in body. It will contain the header of the page

30 40 then put main and foooter

They tell the user about the page, and helps understand the html code

31 00 Working on the header. Show them that you know what you are doing.

<a> in an anchor tag that will be a link to something

inside the <a> we will put the href

3148 <a href="/"> 

it will be used when we deploy the portfolio

32 00 On the right hand side it will be a <nav>. It will contain links so the user can go to useful sites

we need another <a> tag

we will use 2 of them

You can link to internal parts of the document

we will link to the linked in and to the github

33 30 having a good linked in and github will be important to connect with people and show you are not AI

34 00 Using icons for the website

-------ICON\

Go to fontawesome.com

Search for Github and you'll have the free icons from github.

Select the github icon and it will give you a code so you can use it

You can copy the code and use it directly inside of the anchor opening and closing tags

35 00 if you save it like this, you still cannot see it

Go search the fontawesom cdn 6.0

https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome

35 30
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.7.2/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-Evv84Mr4kqVGRNSgIGL/F/aIDqQb7xQ2vcrdIwxfjThSH8CSR7PBEakCr51Ck+w+/U6swU2Im1vVX0SVk9ABhg==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />

copy it in the head sectionn of the document

It will enable the use of fontawesome icons

35 50
Now our website will have the icon showing

Then you can copy it and use fa-linkedin so you can link to your linkedin page

36 00 You can copy your linkedin  personal page and paste it in your href attribute

37 00 adding another attribute to the a tag

in order to open them in new tabs, you use the target attribute

<... target="_blank"... >

This will make it so the webpage is opened in a different blank tab


38 00 With this, the head section of the document is complete for now

-----FOOTER

38 10 Go to the footer

it will contain a p tag for some text. Using an a tag we will add our name

star the repo on github ! 

a public repo will get people to star on it. We will have an href too, to the specific repo of this codebase

<p>By <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/00437110">Erick </a> star the repo on <a target="_blank" href=" "> Github </a></p>

40 00 Beneath the footer,  we will add an extra code in javascript

we will make it change color

it will use document object manipulation, using the script tag


<script>

----------MAIN CONTENT OF PORTFOLIO

41 20 content will be filled, it will be made interactive with javascript and style it with css

41 35 going to work on <main>

create a <section> tag. They add a semantic meaning to our website

we will use div and class in the <section> tag

<div class="intro-header"></div>

42 30 add h1 for the header 1, it is the greatest typography tag, < h1 and p tag

43 10 the div will group our information together

Windows key +. adds an emoji

43 20 you can see the results in your page

below div add a h5 tag, all headers have bolder font

add class intro description
<h5 class="intro-description">
</h5>

Software developer based in El Salvador.

44 50 it will be styled later

44 20 add a new div with class="links-container"

<div class="links-container">
    <a target="_blank" href=""> <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Email me</a>
</div>

So people can email you

Inside the class you can add link-arrow to modify it a bit

Use the icon of arrow to poin to it

<i class="fa-solid link-arrow fa-arrow-right">

47 15 Underneath that link we will include our github and linkedin

Paste the links underneath the email. Remove the icons and add linkedin and Github

48 20 move the icon out ouf the anchor tag
<div class="links-container">
                <i class="fa-solid link-arrow fa-arrow-right"></i>
                <a target="_blank" href=""> Email me</a>

so now it iis the first child of the links container div

add to the href in the a tag with email "mailto:<your email>"

49 00 remove the target="_blank" as it is unnecessary

49 10 Coding the game: 
Within the section tag, at the bottom add a new div

   <div id="play-game">


            </div>

49 45 create a button with an onclick attribute

50 30 Add a div class=color-div, it will have text and the color input that allows the user to put select the background of the webiste

52 10 Add the following code
            <div class="color-div">
                <h4> Pick a color</h4>
                <p>Great. Now it is ruined.</p>
                <input type="color" id="color-picker" onchange="" value="#0084ff" /> 
                <button onclick="">reset </button>

            </div>

input type is a color wheel, the id will be used to identify it, onchange will be added later with javascript and add a color value  of #0084ff

the button will be used to reset later on

52 50 Working on divs that do no display

grab this paragraph text <p>Great. Now it is ruined.</p>

you do not write inline style generally ,but we will do it for certtain elements

this paragraph shouldn't show at first

add : style="display: none;" to hide that text for now

53 50  also add this to the reset button to add it in the meantime

we also want to hide the color picker text and input until the user presses the "play a game"  button

so we hide the whole div with display none too

54 20 we will wire this with javascript to display the game later on
